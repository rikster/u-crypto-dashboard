# Cryptocurrency Dashboard



## Technologies Used
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Styled Components
- wouldnt normally use this, has some advantages
  - real css, re-usable, variables, logic (if then)  
    although autogen component naming is ugly, and a little hard to debug,
    and it mixes js w/ css (no SOC)
  - vs importing .css
    - classes must be carefully named b/c they get injected by webpack index.js, 
      therefore globally scoped
  - vs BEM (Block Element Modifier)
    - still added globally
  - vs css modules are cleaner
    - build time transforms css files into js (webpack)
    - eg. import classes from button.module.css, therefore classes.button 
- Why you should look into these React component styling options!
